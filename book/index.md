# QIIME 2 “Atacama soil microbiome” tutorial


This tutorial is intended to be read like a book, from beginning to end.

This tutorial and the correspnding videos present many new features of QIIME 2
and our education and documentation ecosystem, including:

* The new QIIME 2 [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/)-based graphical user
  interface;
* New q2-gglasso plugin;
* Our new QIIME 2 documentation system, which illustrates how to use QIIME 2
  with different user interfaces, including Galaxy, the QIIME 2 command line
  interface, and the QIIME 2 Python 3 API. You can choose to use whichever of
  these interfaces you're most comfortable with, or user different interfaces
  for different steps;
*  [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)-based QIIME 2
  tutorial.

```{admonition} Important!
Please review the
[QIIME 2 Community Code of Conduct](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-community-code-of-conduct/9057)
. All workshop instructors agreed to abide by these community expectations and
we hope you will too and you become involved in the QIIME 2 community.

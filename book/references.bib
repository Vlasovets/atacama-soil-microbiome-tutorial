              sequences exactly and resolves differences of as little as 1
              nucleotide. In several mock communities, DADA2 identified more
              real variants and output fewer spurious sequences than other
              methods. We applied DADA2 to vaginal samples from a cohort of
              pregnant women, revealing a diversity of previously undetected
              Lactobacillus crispatus variants.",
